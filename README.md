## Overview

TTS Tech Portfolio oversee/manage/coordinate everything technology-related that cuts across TTS, or anything technology-related that will affect TTS from the outside.

## How we operate

- We work in the open, with rare exceptions
- We follow the Amazon model of [reversible decisions](https://fs.blog/2018/04/reversible-irreversible-decisions/)
- We try to minimize [toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) and having to be reactionary for TTS and especially ourselves
- We optimize for team member happiness and productivity
- [Kanban](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Qfvc1P_XBFVk5rM2tGcDBoUjQ/view)-ish and [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum)-y
- Sooner is better than later, later (or never) is better than sooner
  - Try and deliver value quickly and learn from it, while seeing what we can defer to free up time for things that are more pressing.
- Write things down
- Discussions → action items
- We practice [documentation-driven development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
  - While documentation (e.g. [the Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/)) is generally the thing being updated (rather than a README), this should be done incrementally, and thus will be closer to README-Driven Development as it's defined in that post.
  - This applies to building/modifying process just like it applies to building software.

### Exceptions to working in the open

- When the information needs to remain confidential... for _security_ reasons
- When the information needs to remain confidential... for _contractual_ reasons
- When the information needs to remain confidential... for _personnel_ reasons

### Times when it is best to use reversible decisions

- When talking _about_ something takes longer than _just doing_ something
- When we are either accountable or repsonsible for the procedure or outcome
- When we pair it with [radiating intent](https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/dont-ask-forgiveness-radiate-intent-d36fd22393a3)
- When the decision can actually be reversed
