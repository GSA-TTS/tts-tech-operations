**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist

- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or Tech Portfolio is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/platform better. (You can also file issues and pull requests on [the template Onboarding checklist](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md).
- [ ] Once you've finished the checklists below, make suggestions for steps that would have improved your onboarding experience as pull requests on [the onboarding checklist template](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md) used to make this issue.
