**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist

### Getting to know TTS Tech Portfolio

### Required items for all team members

Ensure you know what's happening on the team:

- [ ] Subscribe to the [Tech Portfolio team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z3NhLmdvdl82aDI5YnF1ZGx0NGVoZTVzOWswOGlmdGZxMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) (click the + in the bottom right) so you know when assorted team meetings are happening. Tip: When you plan Out of Office time, make a calendar event for that on the TTS Tech Portfolio calendar so that your teammates know you'll be away.
- [ ] [Watch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) [our repositories](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/how_we_work/github.md)

Learn our policies and procedures:

- [ ] Coordinate with your onboarding buddy to go through [Incident Response Training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AZjQE8zBzMRWZIFUuJPkJLted1ykGtALrLPoPRx5Vls/edit#slide=id.p) within 60 days of joining the team (and annually after that). This will cover the following document, which you should also review before or after training:
- [ ] Read [Before You Ship](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/)
- [ ] Coordinate with your onboarding buddy to go through [nonpublic information training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rXSZZ0t0kadsoP1EMJoM0T7ROkGD3Pr5wojWnf2GksI/edit) within 60 days of joining the team (and annually after that). This will cover the following documents, which you should also review before or after training:

## Buddy checklist

- [ ] Introduce yourself to the new team member and give them some of your background so they know who you are; if you are comfortable, share your Readme and encourage them to create their own
- [ ] Identify a straightforward, well-groomed story in progress that involves their skills domain, schedule a meeting with the owner for an introduction (if it's not you), and setup pairing sessions several times in the first week on the project.
- [ ] Have the person shadow whomever is on [OpsRotation](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/how_we_work/ops_rotation.md), so they can see how we handle support and read with those within TTS.
