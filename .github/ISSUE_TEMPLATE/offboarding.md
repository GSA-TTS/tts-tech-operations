Assignee: The tasks below are organized by the role needed to complete them. If you canʼt complete
any of the items on your checklist personally, you are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate person
does it.
For compliance tracking purposes we need to show when offboarding actions happened; many need to
occur in a 24-hour window. As you do this work, comment on this GitHub issue as you complete each
task. (PS-4: Personnel termination)

# Onboarding Process

NewPerson and Buddy: Try to go through your checklists in order.

Buddy: If you can’t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item.

Tip: When you plan Out of Office time, make a calendar event for that on the TTS Tech Portfolio calendar so that your teammates know you'll be away.

Learn our policies and procedures:

- [ ] Read [Before You Ship](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/)
- [ ] Review the [18F open source policy guidance about protecting sensitive information](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/practice.md#protecting-sensitive-information)

## Buddy checklist

- [ ] Introduce yourself to the new team member and give them some of your background so they know who you are; if you are comfortable, share your Readme and encourage them to create their own
- [ ] Identify a straightforward, well-groomed story in progress that involves their skills domain, schedule a meeting with the owner for an introduction (if it's not you), and setup pairing sessions several times in the first week on the project.
- [ ] Have the person shadow whomever is on [OpsRotation](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/how_we_work/ops_rotation.md), so they can see how we handle support and read with those within TTS.
