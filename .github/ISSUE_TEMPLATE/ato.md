## TODOs

If your system isn't live yet, "production" refers to the environment that _will_ be production.

### Phase 0: As early in the project as possible

#### Project team

- [ ] Request ISSO
- [ ] Assign the appropriate labels to this issue.
- [ ] Read the following:
  - [ ] [Guidelines for GSA's Digital Presence](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/communications/digital-website-communication/policies-and-guidelines/guidelines-for-gsas-digital-presence)
  - [ ] [Hello, production](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2019/10/04/hello-production/)
  - [ ] [The Engineering Practices Guide](https://engineering.18f.gov/), particularly:
    - [ ] [Languages & Runtimes](https://engineering.18f.gov/language-selection/)

  - [ ] Confirm with @[Authorizing Official]

#### ISSO

- [ ] Provide SSP template
- [ ] Lay out long-term ATO path

- [ ] Set up an ATO intro meeting with the project team.
- [ ] Set up the project ATO folder.

#### Project team

##### Technical

These tasks apply to every repository/application/hostname/language that is directly involved in your project.

- [ ] Enable [protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) for the project repository.
  - Get help via #admins-github, if needed.
- [ ] Ensure that your production environment is fully set up, and matches what's described in your ATO materials.
- [ ] [Set up monitoring](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/monitoring/)
  - [ ] [Downtime alerts](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/monitoring/#downtime)
  - [ ] [Error & performance alerts](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/monitoring/#errors--performance-problems)
  - [ ] [DAP](https://digital.gov/dap/)
- [ ] [Log required events](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/logging/#what-to-log)
- [ ] Perform security scans, and put the results (or a link to them) in the project's `ATO folder`.
  - [ ] Set up [dependency analysis](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/security/static-analysis/) service
    - [ ] Add service badge to your README
    - [ ] Put a point-in-time PDF of the scan results in the project's `ATO folder`.
  - [ ] Set up [static code analysis](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/security/static-analysis/)
    - [ ] If using a service, add the badge to your README.
  - [ ] [Perform dynamic vulnerability scanning](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/security/dynamic-scanning/)
    - [ ] Resolve any visible security issues, re-running the scan as needed
    - [ ] Add the issue-free scan report or documentation about false positives to the project's ATO folder.
- [ ] If this is a new system, add a prominent [`Beta`](https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/stages/) label to the site.
- [ ] Ensure the production environment has sufficient capacity to withstand the testing.
  - The testing tools create very heavy usage and traffic.
- [ ] Architecture finalized

##### Documentation

...reading and writing.

- [ ] Read the [Overview](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/) and [the ATO section (including sub-pages)](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/ato/) of Before You Ship.
