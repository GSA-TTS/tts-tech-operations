# Joining the TTS Tech Portfolio team

## Onboarding

Everyone joining the TTS Tech Portfolio team will get assigned a team onboarding buddy. This person should be working on similar things to what you will be working on, so that they can answer questions in your domain.

You and your team onboarding buddy must follow the instructions in [the Onboarding Checklist](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md) to guide you through tasks that will get you up to speed and contributing in no time. You (and your buddy) should track your progress by checking the boxes as you complete tasks.

Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or Tech Portfolio is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/documentation better.

### Checklist

When someone new joins the TTS Tech Portoflio team:

1. [Create a new card in the Tech Portfolio Github repo.](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new?template=onboarding.md&title=onboard+%5BNewPerson%5D)
1. Replace "NewPerson" with the new person's name and "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
1. Submit the card.
1. Assign the person who bravely volunteered to be the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the card.
1. Put the issue into the _In Progress_ column.

In order to get NewPerson productively contributing to the TTS Tech Portfolio team, Buddy should help NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Tools and project artifacts

Whenever possible, we err on the side of putting information where the public can see it and others can benefit from it. Some data might be kept in Google Drive for convenience of presentation, commenting, etc. but we consider public GitHub repositories the intended destination whenever possible.

Several tools are used for project management, but the main one you will probably be using is GitHub to submit and merge pull requests.
