You don't have to have the answers to all the questions, but you should ensure all the questions get answers.

For the `TTS Software` group, we use [Google's Collaborative Inbox](https://support.google.com/a/answer/167430?hl=en) features to manage the status of requests. When on ops-rotation use the `Mark as Completed` to ensure others know a request has been satisfied. For requests that need assistance from others on the team, use the `Assign` feature to task them, include a description of what you need from them. Feel free to use any additional features you may find useful.

### Play: Managing Software requests

Members of TTS will start the [request process](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/software/) when a user needs a piece of software that the TTS Tech Portfolio Manages. They will make a request by sending an email will be sent to tts-software@gsa.gov and show on the [Software Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/tts-software) and whomever is in rotation will answer it. Once the operations rotation receives the email they send a canned response to the requestor letting them know that they’ve gotten it. Once operations rotation person has completed all of their tasks, they will mark the item complete.

Microsoft, Trello, Mural, and InVision require that you go into the back-end and manually add the person into the account.

See the following [administration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Htav6TIgasBvvSroI8H_sQXxnvMlra2k9iabBwQYUs/edit#) and [document guide](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/master/links.md) for links to the user lists, back-end accounts, and template responses.
