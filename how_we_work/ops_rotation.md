# Operations Rotation Playbook

[Create an issue using the Operations Rotation template](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new?template=ops.md) before each Rotation to track tasks. Close once the rotation has ended.

## Communications Monitoring

You don't have to have the answers to all the questions, but you should ensure all the questions get answers.

For the `TTS Software` group, we use [Google's Collaborative Inbox](https://support.google.com/a/answer/167430?hl=en) features to manage the status of requests. When on ops-rotation use the `Mark as Completed` to ensure others know a request has been satisfied. For requests that need assistance from others on the team, use the `Assign` feature to task them, include a description of what you need from them. Feel free to use any additional features you may find useful.

### Play: Managing Software requests

Members of TTS will start the [request process](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/software/) when a user needs a piece of software that the TTS Tech Portfolio Manages. They will make a request by sending an email will be sent to tts-software@gsa.gov and show on the [Software Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/tts-software) and whomever is in rotation will answer it. Once the operations rotation receives the email they send a canned response to the requestor letting them know that theyâ€™ve gotten it. Once operations rotation person has completed all of their tasks, they will mark the item complete.

Microsoft, Trello, Mural, and InVision require that you go into the back-end and manually add the person into the account.

See the following [administration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Htav6TIgasBvvSroI8H_sQXxnvMlra2k9iabBwQYUs/edit#) and [document guide](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/master/links.md) for links to the user lists, back-end accounts, and template responses.
