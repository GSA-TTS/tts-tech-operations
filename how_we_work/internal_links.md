  - `TTS SaaS` is the one we generally use for purchases of SaaS/IaaS.

## Purchase card Documents

- [TTS P-Card Holder Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LxkTsQPA4v4ZpJNpJcnSBX07WVxQQwfVtXKx236EfEU/edit#heading=h.r8batkq4e5mr)
  - This is the process for a p-card holder. However, C2 is being deprecated, so this whole process will be changing. I am happy to help set up the new process and update the handbook and this instruction sheet.
- [SSoT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DZNfdF48bm6ilVWN8E6yK0_FuayAdkp-cZUXfVZf3NM/edit#gid=2005242281)
  - The SSoT is where all p-card purchases in TTS are logged.
- [Melanie P-card Purchases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e0QOx1LviyBOQy83GrBGx3KZV34JDO-nHgyKBtW04ag/edit#gid=1458412487)
  - I have logged my p-card purchases since my start date here. You can look through to see what SaaS we have purchased since November.
- [C2 POC's for ongoing monthly purchases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTiexgyZST-myAKL4Ywb3nyjkG4MrSR2vU_D3WY9dVg/edit#heading=h.inm3pid89mel)
  - Each fiscal year, the C2s need to be reapproved for monthly purchases. The POCs are who you will need to reach out to in order to get this process started. Many of the POCs have termed out and we will need to find replacements.
- [Pegasys Log How-To Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_84e_PwTKaB6E2d4M528xt88WzyS6VnCDUyV4QiogU/edit#heading=h.5lrozuz1qry4)
  - This document lays out step by step how to log a purchase in Pegasys. With the new system, this may not be necessary because it may be automated through Google scripts, but for now, this is the process.
- [Pegasys and P-Card Access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JaXaDMioAgfRMncj-n3henCAF8igmJkCQfcP5-Y9F1U/edit#heading=h.8o69jyg6n7f7)

## ATO and FITARA Information

- [ATO List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuBB6KUJsfGMPBrinB7NQ9NjslhGxLJZa6ZfxeCXJGM/edit#heading=h.frw7bxqjgcsb)
  - This is the ATO list for monthly purchases currently made by TTS. The p-card/infrastructure holder needs to be aware of these so we remain compliant and do not keep renewing purchases that no longer have an approved ATO or FedRAMP.
- [FITARA Trello](https://trello.com/b/KklMfNO0/gsa-it-fitara)
  - The FITARA Trello board marks FITARA requests as they move through the process.
- [FITARA Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e1xM6dUSuQ7KguY8av0dcZXgGTuKSxQV)
  - This is the folder where all FITARA approvals have been kept, since we started moving to the new format.
- [FITARA Email Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16tzuL9_4Kj4YuW8G4oTAZuzkzZnf25PRa0H5jQjfKjc/edit#heading=h.oj4ztzuqdlog)
  - Emails no longer need to be sent for FITARA approval, but this may be helpful to see what has been approved in the past.
- [TTS Recurring SaaS Products](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ZvHF9AEkioThtC-btop4BaSz9NQ9bw28bUoAJWSQQ0/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=114063255069137490946)
  - These are recurring SaaS Products. This was put together to push back on GSA IT and their requirement that all SaaS products be FedRAMPed to continue use. These are not big purchases and FedRAMP is expensive. It’s hard to ask these businesses to be FedRAMPed when we are barely spending money on them. A lot of these products are essential to TTS.
- [TTS System Assessment Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19wyA91KhGoZvnAA0fihC0WF_mU79YLRTHzDd-Frs8Qs/edit#gid=0)

  - This inventory is for all of the SaaS products that TTS owns. With the new process, this should, hopefully, be automatically updated instead of having to go in and do it manually.
- [Security’s LISaaS list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPMrCWfLX5CTVVI8hysUK8DFEKGgGw2L2W-T1jat4LM/edit#gid=0), and [another similar one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u6Mmo7K4aZMZFbwhnymnJ9h4vrra_OBIpfpd3mQYQFg/edit?ts=5e1dff2c#gid=0)

### User Lists

User lists to keep track of SaaS users for systems that are not easy to track in the admin consoles.

  - It’s unclear how many licenses we should be allowed/if we need to do a new contract with Microsoft. When I was handed the licenses, I was told they are unlimited, but I am not sure if that is actually the case.
- [Mural User List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DT_3_SDM8ezbaN3I0FnN3ZYVtJpgkyXqYkO54FcnBro/edit#gid=243236610)
