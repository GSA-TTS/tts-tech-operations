   1. WHEN notice is given

      IF it is a Sprint Planning, Grooming or Retro meeting && it is the Meeting Leader who will be out

      THEN the meeting should proceed AND the task to lead the meeting should fall onto the TTS Tech Portfolio Director

      IF it is a Sprint Planning, Grooming or Retro meeting && it is NOT the Meeting Leader who will be out

      THEN the meeting should proceed AND the Meeting Leader will take extra notes to provide to missing employee so they are able to get caught up

      IF it is a Daily Standup Meeting or Lunch meeting

      THEN proceed without the missing employee && they will provide a standup update ahead of time in slack


    1. WHEN notice is NOT given in advance

        IF it is a Sprint Planning, Grooming or Retro meeting && it is the Meeting Leader who will be out

        THEN the meeting should be combined with the next ceremony

        IF it is a Sprint Planning, Grooming or Retro meeting && it is NOT the Meeting Leader who will be out

       THEN the meeting should proceed AND the Meeting Leader will catch the employee up within 24hrs of missed meeting

        IF it is a Daily Standup Meeting or Lunch meeting

        THEN whoever is in attendance can make a real-time decision on how to proceed && they will provide a standup update after the meeting in slack

## Frequently asked questions

Q: How does the TTS Tech Portfolio define an 'unforseen event'?

A: An unforseen, unpredictable event that occurs out of your control.

Examples:

- What is considered an unforseen event:

  - Previous meeting going long and no way to end it without being rude
  - Family member having to go to the ER
  - Tow truck company being 2hrs late
  - You or a family member being ill + anything listed here describing [what's an emergency](https://www.gov.uk/time-off-for-dependants/whats-an-emergency)
  - No-notice, Expidited task from leadership

- What is not considered an unforseen event:
  - Picnic in the park with a friend
  - Watching a conference talk
  - Finishing a task that was planned for in the Sprint
  - Sunbathing on the roof

If you are unsure if something would be classified as an unforseen event; it is better to ask in the #tts-tech-portfolio slack channel than just assuming.

Q. Why are we documenting this?

A. Have a clear purpose, goals and expectations for the team, build trust among team members & to have equity amongst all team members
