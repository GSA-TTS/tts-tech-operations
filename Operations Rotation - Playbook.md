## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Disclosure Responisbilities

**First Responder**

- Set an email alert via Google Calendar at the 77-day (11 weeks) mark from the date the reporter sent the email, so that, if no response or resolution has yet been made, the team has about 2 weeks to bring the issue to resolution and close out the issue with the reporter.

### Play: Managing Software requests

Start the [request process](https://handbook.18f.gov/software/) when a user needs a piece of software they will make a request by sending an email will be sent to tts-software@gsa.gov and show on the [Software Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/tts-software) and whomever is in rotation will answer it. Once the operations rotation receives the email they send a canned response to the requestor letting them know that theyâ€™ve gotten it. Once operations rotation person has completed all of their tasks, they will mark the item complete.

Microsoft, Adobe, Zoom, Mural, and InVision require that you go into the back-end and manually add the person into the account.

See the following [administration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Htav6TIgasBvvSroI8H_sQXxnvMlra2k9iabBwQYUs/edit#) and [document guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIms6TcYOQ24BerQrxAFzTKAqVS6VNCpWklwTsxBmWA/edit#) for links to the user lists, back-end accounts, and template responses.

##### New member account

> Hi XXXX, I have taken the liberty of adding you to the TTS account for full member access, here is the link if you do not receive an email to that effect. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

##### Guest account

> Would it be possible for your partners to take on Guest accounts? Guests are internal stakeholders, partners and clients working on or reviewing a project or workshop. They have slightly restricted access, but they can collaborate in a mural and access private rooms. Would that meet your needs?

##### Reactivate account

> Hi XXXX, I have taken the liberty of reactivating you to the TTS account for full member access, here is the link if you do not receive an email to that effect. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

##### Request for a member account (when already have one)

> Hi XXXX, It looks like you are already a member in this account, if you would like a link to Mural, I can send you one. If you need access to a board you are working with, please have the creator of that Mural workspace send you a link.
