## Adding a repository

When a repository is considered "managed" by the Tech Portfolio, it should be included in the following places:

- [The list in Terraform](../terraform/main.tf)
- Linked repositories for project boards
  - [Team board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/11/settings/linked_repositories)
  - [Pull requests](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/19/settings/linked_repositories)
