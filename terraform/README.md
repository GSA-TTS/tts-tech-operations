To `plan`/`apply` changes:

1. Ensure AWS CLI is properly configured. Terraform requires access to AWS resources in order to track state as well as to perform the relevant operations

   1. [Download and install AWSCLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
   1. [Configure AWSCLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
      At a minimum, a profile should be created (or the Default profile used) containing your tts-prod AWS account credentials.

      `~/.aws/credentials:`

      ```ini
      [profile_name]
      aws_access_key_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_TTS_PROD
      aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_TTS_PROD
      ```

      `~/.aws/config:`

      ```ini
      [profile_name]
      region=us-west-2
      ```

      Note that using a profile other than `Default` will mean you need to set the environment variable `AWS_PROFILE=profile_name` to the profile containing your tts-prod AWS credentials

1. [Install Terraform.](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
1. [Create a GitHub personal access token.](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
1. In this directory:

   1. Create [a `terraform.tfvars` file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files) with the token

      ```hcl
      github_token = "â€¦"
      ```

   1. Ensure Terraform runs successfuly

      ```sh
      terraform init
      terraform plan
      ```

It should show "no changes". You can then make changes to files, `apply`, etc.

## Changing labels

1. Edit the list in [`repo/vars.tf`](repo/vars.tf).
1. Get the migration commands.

   ```sh
   python rename_label.py "<label before>" "<label after>"
   ```

1. Note this doesn't actually perform the migration. Copy and paste the output into the terminal to execute.
1. When running `terraform plan`/`apply`, it should show those labels being changed, not removed+added.
